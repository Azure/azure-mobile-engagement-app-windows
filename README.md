## Test the Demo App

### Requirements

- Visual Studio 2015, the application is written in C# and targets the Universal Windows Platform
- NuGet : See https://nuget.org

### Installation 

- Open `azme.sln`

- Test locally the emulation of the SDK or create your own AzME campaigns to test push notification, Web Announcement, Poll or Data Push.

### Run the app : use your own AzME Endpoint 

To test the SDK and AzME Platform, configure your Endpoint in `Resources/EngagementConfiguration.xml`

```
    <connectionString>Endpoint=Your_application_endpoint</connectionString>
```
You have to configure an Endpoint otherwise you will not be able to test the app correctly with the SDK.

You can see detailed instructions in the application to discover how to implement notification campaigns in Azure Mobile Engagement back-end.
